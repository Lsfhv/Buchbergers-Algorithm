# Gröbner Basis 

An implementation of Buchbergers algorithm to compute the gröbner basis of an ideal in a polynomialring over the rationals.

For proof of algorithm please refer to 9.26 and necessary prerequisites in Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote.

Can be extended to n variables and extensons of the rationals. 

Format: (f(x_1,x_2), ... , f_n(x_1, x_2))

Output: 
Gröbner basis: {g_1, .. g_m}
Reduced Gröbner basis:{h_1, .. h_k}
