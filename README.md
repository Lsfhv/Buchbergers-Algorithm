# Gröbner Basis 

An implementation of Buchbergers algorithm to compute the gröbner basis of an ideal in a polynomialring over the rationals.

For proof of algorithm please refer to 9.26 and necessary prerequisites in Abstract Algebra by Dummit and Foote.

Can be extended to n variables and extensions of the rationals.
